            <h4>How to play:</h4>
            <p>
                Blackjack is a card game, traditionally played in casinos, that
                pits Player v. Dealer.  The goal of the game is to get as close
                to 21 as possible without going over, which is reffered to as
                busting.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the player's turn, they have two options: Hit or Stand.
                If a player chooses to Hit, the dealer gives them another card.
                If a player chooses to Stand, the complete their turn, passing
                play to the player clockwise of them or to the dealer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dealer's moves are automatic, as they always hit if their
                cards add up to less than 17 or stand if they do.  In the end,
                each player is evaluated to see if they win, lose, or tie,
                called a push.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cards with a number rank (shown in the top-left corner
                typically) are evaluated to their rank, face cards (kings,
                queens, jacks) are evaluated as 10, and aces are either 1 or
                11, whicher is more advantageous to the player.
            </p>
            <p>The winner is determined like this:</p>
            <p>Has the player busted?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yes:</strong> The player loses.</li>
                <li><strong>No:</strong> Continue.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Has the dealer busted?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yes:</strong> The player wins</li>
                <li><strong>No:</strong> Continue.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Compare the scores.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dealer has more points than player?</strong> Dealer wins.</li>
                <li><strong>Player has more points than dealer?</strong> Player wins.</li>
                <li><strong>Dealer and player have equal amounts of points?</strong> It's a push!</li>
            </ul>
